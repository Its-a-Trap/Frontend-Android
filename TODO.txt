TO DO:

- When you trap someone/are trapped, maybe be notified of when the trap was placed?
- Gamification / Graphic qualities
    - Black and white grainy map + trap vibrates into place and kachunks into place
    - When you open the app and someone has tripped one of your traps, you see it increase your score and get a notification or something
    - Cool sonar graphic for sweep
- Sweep
    - Have a cooldown display
    - Maybe indicate how long you're going to get to see them (have them fade out?)
- Kill you when you close the app
- Several of my testers tried to click the “traps left” icon to place a trap. We should make it less clickable, or make it do something
- traps expire / go rogue
- Multithreading crash related to list adapter? (Daniel will fix)


EASY QUICK:
- Change sweep radius

LOW PRIORITY:
- Other login buttons?
- How to show a location-based demo (cheesy video???)
- Sweep is device-specific, shouldn't be

CONCERNS:
- Will this work on Jeff's phone?
