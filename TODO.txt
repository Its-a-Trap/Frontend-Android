TO DO:
- Kill you when you close the app
- Several of my testers tried to click the “traps left” icon to place a trap. We should make it less clickable, or make it do something
- traps expire / go rogue
- Toast when the place / remove call to the server doesn't work, so if you're removing, a trap will disappear from your gui, but not from the server, so the next update it will re-appear
- Make it so tutorial preserves state on rotation
- Notifications when you get a kill


EASY QUICK:
- Change sweep radius


LOW PRIORITY:
- Gamification / Graphic qualities
    - Black and white grainy map + trap vibrates into place and kachunks into place
    - When you open the app and someone has tripped one of your traps, you see it increase your score and get a notification or something
    - Cool sonar graphic for sweep
- Other login buttons?
- How to show a location-based demo (cheesy video???)
- Sweep is device-specific, shouldn't be
- When you trap someone/are trapped, maybe be notified of when the trap was placed?
- traps expire / go rogue


CONCERNS:
- Will this work on Jeff's phone? 

-------------------------

    - Notification + happy sound : "You trapped <person>! +100 points!"
