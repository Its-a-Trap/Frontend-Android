TO DO:

- Notifies you when someone else has run into your trap
- Kill you when you close the app



LOW PRIORITY:
- Gamification / Graphic qualities
    - Black and white grainy map + trap vibrates into place and kachunks into place
    - When you open the app and someone has tripped one of your traps, you see it increase your score and get a notification or something
    - Cool sonar graphic for sweep
- Other login buttons?
- How to show a location-based demo (cheesy video???)
- Sweep is device-specific, shouldn't be
- When you trap someone/are trapped, maybe be notified of when the trap was placed?
- traps expire / go rogue


CONCERNS:
- Will this work on Jeff's phone?
