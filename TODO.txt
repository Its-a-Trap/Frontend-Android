TO DO:

- Fix place and remove bug???
- Hook up scores
    - Display score on map view
    - Scores view centers on you
- When you are trapped, stuff happens
    - You lose points?
- When you trap someone, stuff happens
    - You're notified & gain points
- Gamification / Graphic qualities
    - Black and white grainy map + mine vibrates into place and kachunks into place
    - When you open the app and someone has tripped one of your mines, you see it increase your score and get a notification or something
    - Cool sonar graphic for sweep
- Sweep
    - Have a cooldown display
    - Maybe indicate how long you're going to get to see them (have them fade out?)
- Kill you when you close the app
- Several of my testers tried to click the “mines left” icon to place a mine. We should make it less clickable, or make it do something
- Mines that have been placed but not confirmed should disappear when they’re scrolled off-screen.
- Tutorial
- Mines expire / go rogue

EASY QUICK:
- Change sweep radius

LOW PRIORITY:
- Other login buttons?
- How to show a location-based demo (cheesy video???)
- Sweep is device-specific, shouldn't be
